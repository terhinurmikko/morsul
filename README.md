ontology in Turtle for representing the content of ancient Sumerian literary compositions as published on ETCSL (http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/). Ontology comprises of classes and properties from CIDOC-CRM(http://www.cidoc-crm.org/), FRBRoo(http://www.cidoc-crm.org/frbroo/home-0), Ontomedia(http://www.contextus.net/ontomedia) and some that I've added. You might be interested in the ramblings that constitute the PhD thesis (the reason why I created mORSuL in the first place): https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/377913/1/Nurmikko-Fuller_2015_thesis.pdf .
